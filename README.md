# BrainNoiseWall  

Listen to the sound of your mind in VR! This project allows you to connect real-time EEG data from a Muse headset to sound sources in VR.  
This repository contains an example Unity project for SteamVR (using an HTC Vive headset). If you just want the code to reuse in other Unity projects, check out the [Scripts](https://github.com/Eyemole/brain-noise-wall/tree/master/Assets/Scripts) folder. Note that this project has [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) as a dependency.
